This guide describes how to build a Spring Boot application configured with Spring Session to transparently
leverage {data-store-name} in order to manage a Web application's `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession`.

In this sample, we will use {data-store-name}'s client/server topology with a Spring Boot application that is both a
Web application and a {data-store-name} client configured to manage `HttpSession` state stored in a cluster of
{data-store-name} servers, which are configured and started with
{data-store-docs}/tools_modules/gfsh/chapter_overview.html[_Gfsh_].

In addition, this sample configures and uses {data-store-name}'s
{data-store-docs}/developing/data_serialization/gemfire_data_serialization.html[_DataSerialization_] framework
and {data-store-docs}/developing/delta_propagation/chapter_overview.html[Delta propagation] functionality
to serialize the `HttpSession`.  Therefore, it is necessary to perform additional configuration steps to properly setup
{data-store-name}'s _DataSerialization_ capabilities on the servers so {data-store-name} properly recognizes
the Spring Session types.

== Updating Dependencies

Before using Spring Session, you must ensure that the required dependencies are included.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `dependencies` in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>

	<!-- ... -->

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-session-data-geode</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-session-data-geode-version}</version>
		<type>pom</type>
	</dependency>

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
	</dependency>

</dependencies>
----

ifeval::["{version-snapshot}" == "true"]
Since we are using a SNAPSHOT version, we need to add the Spring Snapshot Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>

	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshot</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
	</repository>

</repositories>
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{version-milestone}" == "true"]
Since we are using a Milestone version, we need to add the Spring Milestone Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>

	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestone</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
	</repository>

</repositories>

== Spring Boot Configuration

After adding the required dependencies and repository declarations, we can create the Spring configuration for our
{data-store-name} client using Spring Boot.  The Spring configuration is responsible for creating a Servlet `Filter`
that replaces the Web container's `HttpSession` with an implementation backed by Spring Session, which is then stored
and managed in {data-store-name}.

[[httpsession-springboot-apachegeode-client-web-application]]
=== The Spring Boot, {data-store-name} `ClientCache`, Web application

Let's start by creating a Spring Boot, Web application to expose our Web Service using Spring Web MVC, running as
an {data-store-name} client, connected to our {data-store-name} servers.  The Web application will use Spring Session
backed by {data-store-name} to manage `HttpSession` state in a distributed and replicated manner.

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire-with-gfsh-servers/src/main/java/sample/client/Application.java[tags=class]
----

<1> We start by declaring our Web application to be a Spring Boot application simply by annotating our application class
with `@SpringBootApplication`.
<2> We also declare our Web application to be an Apache Geode client by annotating our application class with
`@ClientCacheApplication`.  Additionally, we set `subscriptionEnabled` to receive notifications for any updates
to the `HttpSession` that may have originated from a different application client accessing the same `HttpSession`.
<3> Next, we declare that the Web application will use Spring Session backed by {data-store-name} by annotating the
application class with `@EnableGemFireHttpSession`.  This will create the necessary client-side PROXY `Region`,
which we have explicitly named "_Sessions_".  This name must correspond to a server-side `Region` with the same name.
All `HttpSession` state will be sent from the client to the server through `Region` data access operations
using the "DEFAULT" connection `Pool`.
<4> `@Controller` is a Spring Web MVC annotation enabling our MVC handler mapping methods (i.e. methods annotated
with `@RequestMapping`, etc) to process HTTP requests (e.g. <7>)
<5> Then, we adjust the Spring Web MVC configuration to set the home page, and...
<6> Add an error handler to print out the Stack Trace of any Exception thrown by the server.
<7> Finally, we declare the `/session` HTTP request handler method to set an `HttpSession` attribute
and increment a count for the number of HTTP requests that have occurred during this `HttpSession`.

There are many other useful utility methods, so please refer to the actual source code for full details.

TIP: In typical {data-store-name} production deployments, where the cluster includes potentially hundreds or thousands
of servers (a.k.a. data nodes), it is more common for clients to connect to 1 or more {data-store-name} Locators running
in the same cluster. A Locator passes meta-data to clients about the servers available in the cluster, the individual
server load and which servers have the client's data of interest, which is particularly important for direct, single-hop
data access and latency-sensitive applications.  See more details about the
{data-store-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/standard_client_server_deployment.html[Client/Server Topology]
in the {data-store-name} User Guide.

NOTE: For more information on configuring {sdg-name}, refer to the {sdg-docs}[Reference Guide].

[[httpsession-springsession-configuration]]
==== Enabling `HttpSession` Management

The `@EnableGemFireHttpSession` annotation enables developers to configure certain aspects of both Spring Session
and {data-store-name} out-of-the-box, using the following attributes:

* `clientRegionShortcut` - Configures the {data-store-docs}/developing/region_options/region_types.html[data management policy]
on the client using the {data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/client/ClientRegionShortcut.html[ClientRegionShortcut].
Defaults to `PROXY`.  Only applicable on the client.
* `indexableSessionAttributes` - Identifies the `HttpSession` attributes by name that should be indexed for queries.
Only Session attributes explicitly identified by name will be indexed.
* `maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds` - Controls `HttpSession` Idle Expiration Timeout (TTI; defaults to **30 minutes**).
* `poolName` - Name of the dedicated connection `Pool` connecting the client to a cluster of servers.
Defaults to `gemfirePool`. Only applicable on the client.
* `regionName` - Declares the name of the `Region` used to store and manage `HttpSession` state.
Defaults to "_ClusteredSpringSessions_".
* `serverRegionShortcut` - Configures the {data-store-docs}/developing/region_options/region_types.html[data management policy]
on the server using the {data-store-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/RegionShortcut.html[RegionShortcut]
Defaults to `PARTITION`.  Only applicable on the server, or when the P2P topology is employed.
* `sessionExpirationPolicyBeanName` - Configures the name of the bean declared in the Spring context implementing
the Expiration Policy used by {data-store-name} to expire stale `HttpSessions`.  Defaults to unset.
* `sessionSerializerBeanName` - Configures the name of the bean declared in the Spring context used to handle
de/serialization of the `HttpSession` between client and server.  Defaults to PDX.

NOTE: It is important to remember that the {data-store-name} client `Region` name must match a server `Region`
by the same name if the client `Region` is a `PROXY` or `CACHING_PROXY`.  Client and server `Region` names are not
required to match if the client `Region` is `LOCAL`.  However, keep in mind that by using a client `LOCAL` Region,
`HttpSession` state will not be propagated to the server and you lose all the benefits of using {data-store-name}
to store and manage `HttpSession` state on the servers in a distributed, replicated manner.

[[httpsession-apachegeode-servers-gfsh]]
=== Starting {data-store-name} Servers with Gfsh

Now, we must start a small {data-store-name} cluster.

For this sample, we will start 1 Locator and 2 Servers.  In addition, we will create the "Sessions" `Region` used
to store and manage the `HttpSession` in the cluster as a `PARTITION` `Region` using an Idle Expiration (TTI)
timeout of 15 seconds.

The following example shows the Gfsh shell script we will use to setup the cluster:

[source,txt]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire-with-gfsh-servers/src/main/resources/geode/bin/start-cluster.gfsh[tags=shell-script]
----

NOTE: You will minimally need to replace path to the `CACHE_XML_FILE` depending on where you cloned the
{gh-url}[Spring Session for {data-store-name}] to on your system.

This Gfsh shell script file contains two additional bits of key information.

First, the shell script configures the CLASSPATH of the servers to contain all the Spring JARs.  If there were
application domain classes being stored in the `HttpSession` (i.e. in Session attributes), then a JAR file containing
the application types must also be on the CLASSPATH of the servers.

This is necessary since, when {data-store-name} applies a delta (i.e. the client only sends `HttpSession` changes
to the servers), it must deserialize the `HttpSession` object in order to apply the delta.  Therefore, it is also
necessary to have your application domain objects present on the CLASSPATH as well.

Second, we must include a small snippet of `cache.xml` to initialize the {data-store-name} _DataSerialization_
framework in order to register and enable {data-store-name} to recognize the Spring Session types representing
the `HttpSession`.  {data-store-name} is very precise and will only use _DataSerialization_ for the types
it knows about through registration.

But, as a user, you do not need to worry about which Spring Session types {data-store-name} needs to know about.
That is the job of the Spring Session for {data-store-name}'s
`o.s..session.data.gemfire.serialization.data.support.DataSerializableSessionSerializerInitializer` class.

You simply just need to declare the provided Initializer in `cache.xml`, as follows:

[source,xml]
----
include::{samples-dir}boot/gemfire-with-gfsh-servers/src/main/resources/initializer-cache.xml[tags=cache-xml]
----

Then, you include the `initializer-cache.xml` in the configuration of the server on startup:

[source,txt]
----
gfsh> start server --name=Server1 ... --cache-xml-file=/absolute/filesystem/path/to/initializer-cache.xml
----

Of course, the `start-cluster.gfsh` shell script shown above handles these details for us.  You may recycle this Gfsh
shell script for your own purposes.

[[httpsession-sample-boot-with-gfsh-servers-run]]
== Running the Sample

Now it is time to run our sample.

In order to run the sample, you must install a full installation of {data-store-name}.  You can download the bits
from {data-store-website}/releases[here].

After install, run Gfsh:

[source,txt]
----
$ gfsh
    _________________________     __
   / _____/ ______/ ______/ /____/ /
  / /  __/ /___  /_____  / _____  /
 / /__/ / ____/  _____/ / /    / /
/______/_/      /______/_/    /_/    1.6.0

Monitor and Manage Apache Geode
gfsh>
----

=== Running the server-side cluster

We start the cluster by executing our `start-cluster.gfsh` shell script:

[source,txt]
----
gfsh> run --file=${SYS_USER_HOME}/spring-session-data-geode/samples/boot/gemfire-with-gfsh-servers/src/main/resources/geode/bin/start-cluster.gfsh
----

In the shell, you will see each command listed out as it is executed by Gfsh and you will see the Locator
and Servers startup, and the "_Sessions_" Region get created.

If all is well, you should be able to `list members`, `describe region`, and so on:

[source,txt]
----
gfsh> list members
  Name   | Id
-------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------
Locator1 | 10.99.199.41(Locator1:80666:locator)<ec><v0>:1024 [Coordinator]
Server1  | 10.99.199.41(Server1:80669)<v1>:1025
Server2  | 10.99.199.41(Server2:80672)<v2>:1026

gfsh> list regions
List of regions
---------------
Sessions

gfsh> describe region --name=/Sessions
..........................................................
Name            : Sessions
Data Policy     : partition
Hosting Members : Server1
                  Server2

Non-Default Attributes Shared By Hosting Members

 Type  |          Name           | Value
------ | ----------------------- | ---------
Region | data-policy             | PARTITION
       | entry-idle-time.timeout | 15
       | size                    | 0
       | statistics-enabled      | true
----

The "_Sessions_" Region configuration shown above is exactly the same configuration that Spring would have created
for you if you were to configure and bootstrap your {data-store-name} servers using Spring Boot instead.

For instance, you can achieve a similar effect with the following Spring Boot application class, which can be used to
configure and bootstrap an {data-store-name} server:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@CacheServerApplication
@EnableGemFireHttpSession(regionName = "Sessions",
    maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds = 15)
public class ServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        new SpringApplicationBuilder(ServerApplication.class)
            .web(WebApplicationType.NONE)
            .build()
            .run(args);
    }
}
----

The nice thing about this approach is, whether you are launching the `ServerApplication` class from you IDE,
or by using a Spring Boot JAR, since the Maven POM (or alternatively, Gradle build file) defines all your dependencies,
you do not need to worry about the CLASSPATH (other than, perhaps your own application domain object types).

This approach is shown in the
link:guides/boot-gemfire.html[HttpSession with Spring Boot and {data-store-name} Sample Guide].

=== Running the client

Now, it is time to run the Spring Boot, {data-store-name} client, Web application.

You can start the Web application from your IDE, or alternatively use the `bootRun` Gradle task
to launch the application:

[source,txt]
----
$ gradlew :spring-session-sample-boot-gemfire-with-gfsh-servers:bootRun
----

Once you have started the client, you can navigate your Web browser to `http://localhost:8080/ping`.  You should see
the "PONG" response.

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.  This will return the `index.html` page where you can submit HTTP requests
and add session attributes.  The page will refresh with a count of the number of HTTP requests for the current session.
After 15 seconds, the HTTP session will expire and you will not longer see any session attributes. Additionally, your
HTTP request count will reset to 0.

image::{samples-dir}/boot/gemfire-with-gfsh-servers/sample-boot-gemfire-with-gfsh-servers.png[]

While the application is running and before the HTTP session times out (again, the TTI expiration timeout is set to
15 seconds), you can issue queries in Gfsh to see the contents of the "_Sessions)" Region.

For example:

[source,txt]
----
gfsh>query --query="SELECT session.id FROM /Sessions session"
Result : true
Limit  : 100
Rows   : 1

Result
------------------------------------
9becc38f-7249-4bd0-94eb-acff70f92b87


gfsh>query --query="SELECT session.getClass().getName() FROM /Sessions session"
Result : true
Limit  : 100
Rows   : 1

Result
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
org.springframework.session.data.gemfire.AbstractGemFireOperationsSessionRepository$DeltaCapableGemFireSession


gfsh>query --query="SELECT attributes.key, attributes.value FROM /Sessions session, session.attributes attributes"
Result : true
Limit  : 100
Rows   : 3

    key      | value
------------ | -----
requestCount | 2
testTwo      | bar
testOne      | foo
----

The list of {data-store-name} OQL queries used in this sample can be found in:

.src/main/resources/geode/oql/queries.txt

----

== Conclusion

In this sample, we saw how to specifically configure and bootstrap a {data-store-name} cluster of servers with Gfsh
and then connect to the cluster using a Spring Boot application enabled with Spring Session, configured with
{data-store-name} as the backing store used to manage the `HttpSessions` for the Web application.

Additionally, the application used {data-store-name}'s _DataSerialization_ framework to serialize the `HttpSession`
state to the servers and also send deltas.  The setup and configuration expressed in the Gfsh shell script
was necessary in order for {data-store-name} to properly identify the Spring Session types to handle.

Feel free to modify this sample and play around for your learning purposes.
