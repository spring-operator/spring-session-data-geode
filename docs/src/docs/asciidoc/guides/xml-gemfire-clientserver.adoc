= Spring Session - HttpSession with Apache Geode Client/Server using XML Configuration
John Blum
:toc:

This guide describes how to configure _Spring Session_ to transparently leverage Apache Geode to manage
a Web application's `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` using XML Configuration.

NOTE: The completed guide can be found in the <<spring-session-sample-xml-geode-clientserver,Spring XML Configuation>>.

== Updating Dependencies

Before using _Spring Session_, you must ensure that the required dependencies are included.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `dependencies` in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-session-data-geode</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-session-data-geode-version}</version>
		<type>pom</type>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
		<version>${spring-version}</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

ifeval::["{version-snapshot}" == "true"]
Since we are using a SNAPSHOT version, we need to add the _Spring_ Snapshot Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshot</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{version-milestone}" == "true"]
Since we are using a Milestone version, we need to add the _Spring_ Milestone Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestone</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

== Spring XML Configuration

After adding the required dependencies and repository declarations, we can create the _Spring_ configuration.
The _Spring_ configuration is responsible for creating a `Servlet` `Filter` that replaces the `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession`
with an implementation backed by _Spring Session_ and Apache Geode.

===  Client Configuration

Add the following _Spring_ configuration:

[source,xml]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/session-client.xml[tags=beans]
----

<1> (Optional) First, we can include a `Properties` bean to configure certain aspects of the Apache Geode `ClientCache`
using https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/12/reference/topics/gemfire_properties.html[Pivotal GemFire Properties].
In this case, we are just setting Apache Geode's "`log-level`" from a application-specific System property,
defaulting to "`warning`" if unspecified.
<2> We must create an instance of an Apache Geode `ClientCache` initialized with our `gemfireProperties`.
<3> Then we configure a `Pool` of client connections to talk to the Apache Geode Server in our Client/Server topology.
In our configuration, we use sensible settings for timeouts, number of connections and so on. Also, our `Pool`
has been configured to connect directly to the server.
<4> Finally, a `GemFireHttpSessionConfiguration` bean is registered to enable _Spring Session_ functionality.

TIP: In typical Apache Geode production deployments, where the cluster includes potentially hundreds or thousands
of Apache Geode servers (data nodes), it is more common for clients to connect to 1 or more Apache Geode Locators running
in the cluster.  A Locator passes meta-data to clients about the servers available in the cluster, the server load
and which servers have the client's data of interest, which is particularly important for direct, single-hop data access
and latency-sensitive operations.  See more details about the
https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/12/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/standard_client_server_deployment.html[Client/Server Deployment]
in the Apache Geode User Guide.

NOTE: For more information on configuring _Spring Data Geode, refer to the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/docs/current/reference/html/[Reference Guide].

=== Server Configuration

So far, we only covered one side of the equation.  We also need an Apache Geode Server for our cache client to talk to
and send Session state to the server to manage.

In this sample, we will use the following XML configuration to spin up an Apache Geode Server:

[source,xml]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/session-server.xml[tags=beans]
----

<1> (Optional) First, we can include a `Properties` bean to configure certain aspects of the Apache Geode peer `Cache`
using https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/12/reference/topics/gemfire_properties.html[Pivotal GemFire Properties].
In this case, we are just setting Apache Geode's "`log-level`" from a application-specific System property,
defaulting to "`warning`" if unspecified.
<2> We must configure an Apache Geode peer `Cache` instance initialized with the Apache Geode properties.
<3> Next, we define a `CacheServer` with sensible configuration for `bind-address` and `port` used by our cache client
application to connect to the server to pass Session state.
<4> Finally, we enable the same _Spring Session_ functionality we declared in the client XML configuration
by registering an instance of `GemFireHttpSessionConfiguration`, except we set the Session expiration timeout
to **30 seconds**. We explain what this means later.

The Apache Geode Server gets bootstrapped with the following:

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/java/sample/ServerConfig.java[tags=class]
----

TIP: Rather than defining a simple Java class with a `main` method, you might consider using _Spring Boot_ instead.

<1> The `@Configuration` annotation designates this Java class as a source of _Spring_ configuration meta-data using
7.9. Annotation-based container configuration[_Spring's_ annotation configuration support].
<2> Primarily, the configuration comes from the `META-INF/spring/session-server.xml` file.

== XML Servlet Container Initialization

Our <<httpsession-spring-xml-configuration,Spring XML Configuration>> created a _Spring_ bean named `springSessionRepositoryFilter`
that implements `javax.servlet.Filter` intervace. The `springSessionRepositoryFilter` bean is responsible for replacing
the `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` with a custom implementation that is provided by _Spring Session_ and Apache Geode.

In order for our `Filter` to do its magic, we need to instruct _Spring_ to load our `session-client.xml` configuration file.

We do this with the following configuration:

.src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=context-param]
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=listeners]
----

The https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#context-create[ContextLoaderListener]
reads the `contextConfigLocation` context parameter value and picks up our _session-client.xml_ configuration file.

Finally, we need to ensure that our Servlet container (i.e. Tomcat) uses our `springSessionRepositoryFilter`
for every request.

The following snippet performs this last step for us:

.src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=springSessionRepositoryFilter]
----

The https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/DelegatingFilterProxy.html[DelegatingFilterProxy]
will look up a bean by the name of `springSessionRepositoryFilter` and cast it to a `Filter`. For every HTTP request,
the `DelegatingFilterProxy` is invoked, which delegates to the `springSessionRepositoryFilter`.
// end::config[]

== HttpSession with Apache Geode (Client/Server) using XML Sample Application


=== Running the httpsession-gemfire-clientserver-xml Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following commands.

First, you need to run the server using:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-javaconfig-gemfire-clientserver:run
----

Now, in a separate terminal, you can run the client using:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-javaconfig-gemfire-clientserver:tomcatRun
----

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/.

In this sample, the web application is the Apache Geode cache client
and the server is standalone, separate (JVM) process.

=== Exploring the httpsession-gemfire-clientserver-xml Sample Application

Try using the application. Fill out the form with the following information:

* **Attribute Name:** _username_
* **Attribute Value:** _john_

Now click the **Set Attribute** button. You should now see the values displayed in the table.

=== How does it work?

We interact with the standard `HttpSession` in the `SessionServlet` shown below:

.src/main/java/sample/SessionServlet.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/java/sample/SessionServlet.java[tags=class]
----

Instead of using Tomcat's `HttpSession`, we are actually persisting the Session in Apache Geode.

_Spring Session_ creates a cookie named SESSION in your browser that contains the id of your Session.
Go ahead and view the cookies (click for help with https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/resources#cookies[Chrome]
or https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Cookies_Panel#Cookies_List[Firefox]).

NOTE: The following instructions assume you have a local Apache Geode installation.  For more information on installation,
see https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/12/prereq_and_install.html[Prerequisites and Installation Instructions].

If you like, you can easily remove the session using `gfsh`.

For example, on a Linux-based system type the following at the command-line:

	$ gfsh

Then, enter the following commands in _Gfsh_, ensuring to replace `70002719-3c54-4c20-82c3-e7faa6b718f3` with the value
of your SESSION cookie, or the Session id returned by the Apache Geode OQL query (which should match):

....
gfsh>connect --jmx-manager=localhost[1099]

gfsh>query --query='SELECT * FROM /ClusteredSpringSessions.keySet'

Result     : true
startCount : 0
endCount   : 20
Rows       : 1

Result
------------------------------------
70002719-3c54-4c20-82c3-e7faa6b718f3

NEXT_STEP_NAME : END

gfsh>remove --region=/ClusteredSpringSessions --key="70002719-3c54-4c20-82c3-e7faa6b718f3"
....

NOTE: The _Apache Geode User Guide_ contains more detailed instructions on using
https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/12/tools_modules/gfsh/chapter_overview.html[gfsh].

Now visit the application at `http://localhost:8080/` again and observe the attribute we added is no longer displayed.

Alternatively, you can wait **20 seconds** for the Session to timeout and expire and then refresh the page.
The attribute we added should no longer be displayed in the table. However, keep in mind, by refreshing the page,
you will inadvertently create a new (empty) Session.  If you run the query again, you will also see two Session ids,
the new and the old, since Apache Geode keeps a "tombstone" of the old Session around.
