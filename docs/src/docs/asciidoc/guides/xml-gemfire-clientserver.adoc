= Spring Session - HttpSession with Apache Geode Client/Server using XML Configuration
John Blum
:toc:

This guide describes how to configure Apache Geode as a provider in Spring Session to transparently manage
a Web application's `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` using XML Configuration.

NOTE: The completed guide can be found in the <<spring-session-sample-xml-geode-clientserver,Spring XML Configuation>>.

== Updating Dependencies

Before using Spring Session, you must ensure that the required dependencies are included.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `dependencies` in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->

	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.session</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-session-data-geode</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-session-data-geode-version}</version>
		<type>pom</type>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
		<version>{spring-version}</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

ifeval::["{version-snapshot}" == "true"]
Since we are using a SNAPSHOT version, we need to add the Spring Snapshot Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshot</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

ifeval::["{version-milestone}" == "true"]
Since we are using a Milestone version, we need to add the Spring Milestone Maven Repository.
If you are using _Maven_, include the following `repository` declaration in your `pom.xml`:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<!-- ... -->

	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestone</id>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
endif::[]

== Spring XML Configuration

After adding the required dependencies and repository declarations, we can create the Spring configuration.
The Spring configuration is responsible for creating a `Servlet` `Filter` that replaces the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` with an implementation backed by Spring Session and Apache Geode.

===  Client Configuration

Add the following Spring configuration:

[source,xml]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring/session-client.xml[tags=beans]
----

<1> (Optional) First, we can include a `Properties` bean to configure certain aspects of the Apache Geode `ClientCache`
using {data-store-docs}/reference/topics/gemfire_properties.html[Pivotal GemFire Properties]. In this case, we are just
setting Apache Geode's "`log-level`" using an application-specific System property, defaulting to "`warning`"
if unspecified.
<2> We must create an instance of an Apache Geode `ClientCache`.  We initialize it with our `gemfireProperties`.
<3> Then we configure a `Pool` of connections to talk to the Apache Geode Server in our Client/Server topology.
In our configuration, we use sensible settings for timeouts, number of connections and so on. Also, our `Pool`
has been configured to connect directly to the server (using the nested `gfe:server` element).
<4> Finally, a `GemFireHttpSessionConfiguration` bean is registered to enable Spring Session functionality.

TIP: In typical Apache Geode production deployments, where the cluster includes potentially hundreds or thousands
of servers (a.k.a. data nodes), it is more common for clients to connect to 1 or more Apache Geode Locators running
in the same cluster. A Locator passes meta-data to clients about the servers available in the cluster, the individual
server load and which servers have the client's data of interest, which is particularly important for direct,
single-hop data access and latency-sensitive applications.  See more details about the
{data-store-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/standard_client_server_deployment.html[Client/Server Deployment]
in the Apache Geode User Guide.

NOTE: For more information on configuring Spring Data for Apache Geode, refer to the {sdg-docs}[Reference Guide].

=== Server Configuration

So far, we only covered one side of the equation.  We also need an Apache Geode Server for our cache client to talk to
and send session state to the server to manage.

In this sample, we will use the following XML configuration to spin up an Apache Geode Server:

[source,xml]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/session-server.xml[tags=beans]
----

<1> (Optional) First, we can include a `Properties` bean to configure certain aspects of the Apache Geode peer `Cache`
using {data-store-docs}/reference/topics/gemfire_properties.html[Pivotal GemFire Properties]. In this case, we are just
setting Apache Geode's "`log-level`" using an application-specific System property, defaulting to "`warning`"
if unspecified.
<2> We must configure an Apache Geode peer `Cache` instance. We initialize it with the Apache Geode properties.
<3> Next, we define a `CacheServer` with sensible configuration for `bind-address` and `port` used by our cache client
application to connect to the server and send session state.
<4> Finally, we enable the same Spring Session functionality we declared in the client XML configuration
by registering an instance of `GemFireHttpSessionConfiguration`, except we set the session expiration timeout
to **30 seconds**. We explain what this means later.

The Apache Geode Server gets bootstrapped with the following:

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/java/sample/server/GemFireServer.java[tags=class]
----

TIP: Rather than defining a simple Java class with a `main` method, you might consider using Spring Boot instead.

<1> The `@Configuration` annotation designates this Java class as a source of Spring configuration meta-data using
7.9. Annotation-based container configuration[Spring's annotation configuration support].
<2> Primarily, the configuration comes from the `META-INF/spring/session-server.xml` file.

== XML Servlet Container Initialization

Our <<httpsession-spring-xml-configuration,Spring XML Configuration>> created a Spring bean named `springSessionRepositoryFilter`
that implements `javax.servlet.Filter` interface. The `springSessionRepositoryFilter` bean is responsible for replacing
the `javax.servlet.http.HttpSession` with a custom implementation that is provided by Spring Session and Apache Geode.

In order for our `Filter` to do its magic, we need to instruct Spring to load
our `session-client.xml` configuration file.

We do this with the following configuration:

.src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=context-param]
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=listeners]
----

The https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#context-create[ContextLoaderListener]
reads the `contextConfigLocation` context parameter value and picks up our _session-client.xml_ configuration file.

Finally, we need to ensure that our Servlet container (i.e. Tomcat) uses our `springSessionRepositoryFilter`
for every request.

The following snippet performs this last step for us:

.src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=springSessionRepositoryFilter]
----

The https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/DelegatingFilterProxy.html[DelegatingFilterProxy]
will look up a bean by the name of `springSessionRepositoryFilter` and cast it to a `Filter`. For every HTTP request,
the `DelegatingFilterProxy` is invoked, which delegates to the `springSessionRepositoryFilter`.
// end::config[]

== HttpSession with Apache Geode (Client/Server) using XML Sample Application


=== Running the httpsession-gemfire-clientserver-xml Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following commands.

First, you need to run the server using:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-javaconfig-gemfire-clientserver:run
----

Now, in a separate terminal, you can run the client using:

----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-javaconfig-gemfire-clientserver:tomcatRun
----

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/.

In this sample, the Web application is the Apache Geode cache client and the server is a standalone, separate
JVM process.

=== Exploring the httpsession-gemfire-clientserver-xml Sample Application

Try using the application. Fill out the form with the following information:

* **Attribute Name:** _username_
* **Attribute Value:** _john_

Now click the **Set Attribute** button. You should now see the values displayed in the table.

=== How does it work?

We interact with the standard `HttpSession` in the `SessionServlet` shown below:

.src/main/java/sample/SessionServlet.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}xml/gemfire-clientserver/src/main/java/sample/client/SessionServlet.java[tags=class]
----

Instead of using Tomcat's `HttpSession`, we are actually persisting the Session in Apache Geode.

Spring Session creates a cookie named SESSION in your browser that contains the id of your Session.
