= Spring Session for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire

_Spring Session_ aims to provide a common infrastructure for managing Sessions.

_Spring Session for Apache Geode_ positions either https://pivotal.io/pivotal-gemfire[Pivotal GemFire]
or https://geode.apache.org/[Apache Geode] as a Session Repository provider.

This provides many benefits including:

* Accessing a Session from any environment (i.e. web, messaging infrastructure, etc)
* In a web environment
** Support for clustering in a vendor/technology neutral way
** Pluggable strategy for determining the Session ID
** Easily keep the HttpSession alive when a WebSocket is active
